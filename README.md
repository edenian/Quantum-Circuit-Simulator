# Quantum-Circuit-Simulator

This project gradually builds a generalised Quantum Circuit Simulator and was done as a part of the bid for the [Quantum Open Source Foundation Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/). The simulator can implement any gate and was built to accommodate a sensible amount of qubits. Additionally, simulator supports parametric gates and can be customised to run variational quantum algorithms. My bid was successful and I was chosen for the program.
